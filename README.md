udacitynanodegreewebproject2
============================
This project is for Udacity's front end web developer nanodegree. This is project 1, version 1 for cohort #1: the interactive resume. 
The languages used are HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
The goal is to create a resume that interacts with elements in the web, like: maps, social media, user input, etc.
Ulimately, this basic site will be enhanced to add more functionality, like: 
        a. live links that to go twitter, linkedin, websites, etc. Currently, there are no real links. 
        b. ability of users to interact with the resume. It will be cool if a recruiter could leave a note or a comment, or if            people can leave a recommendation.
        c. Analytics, to see how many views the resume had.
